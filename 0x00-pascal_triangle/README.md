# Pascal's Triangle

This is a function that generates Pascal's Triangle up to the nth row and returns it as a list of lists of integers.

## Problem Statement

Create a function `pascal_triangle(n)` that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal's Triangle of n:

- Returns an empty list if n <= 0
- You can assume n will always be an integer
